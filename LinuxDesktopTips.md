# Linux Desktop Tips

## Environment

These tips apply primarily to a basic Debian/GNOME running on a laptop.

## Essential applications

### uLauncher

A good alternative to applications like Alfred on a Mac or Launchy on Windows.

Allows you to open applications in a quick and convenient way.

**Open uLauncher**

By default uLauncher will use `Ctrl+Space` as the primary shortcut.

You can always add custom shortcuts through Settings > Keyboard.

In that case your command will be `ulauncher-toggle`

### Development tools

- Robo3T
- DBeaver
- Meld
- GitCola
- Atom
- Sublime Text

### Communicators

- Signal
- Rambox (multiple communicators embedded in one app)
- Slack

### Other apps

- VLC
- Spotify
- Mailspring / Geary / Evolution
- Brave
- GNOME Tweaks
- TLP
- Photopea

## GNOME extensions

- Vitals
- CPU power manager
- Desktop icons ng (ding)
- Extended Gestures (Wayland) / TouchEgg (X11)
- Activities configurator
- Caffeine
- Dash to dock
- Sound input & output device chooser
- User themes
- Workspace indicator

## Themes

The stock GNOME theme is reasonably good.

My preferred overrides:

- UI Font: Inter
- App theme: Adwaita-light-OSX
- Icons: Marwaita

<br /><br />

## Caveats

- In order for VNC to work you need to use an X11 session (not Wayland)
